# Intro to Ethereum

double spending problem in digital assets
    why there is a need for a centralized authority
bitcoin: how it solves the double spending problem

smart contracts: a computer program *directly* that manipulates digital assets. Important to note that this happens directly. 

they exist outside of crypto world too! Like self executing financial instruments, insurance, fundraisers

ENS: Ethereum name system

There are challenges of scalability. 
BTC : 3-4 transactions/sec
ETH : 5 t/s
visa : > 10^6 t/s
stock exchanges : > 10^8 t/s
IoT : > 10^12 t/s

to solve the scalability: plasma, shorting, stake channels, perune?? 
    what if not every

blockchains great at resolving conflicts: computations can be used only to resolve disagreements

problems with replacing centralized computing
    blockchain great at parallel computing
    sec

Ethereum's aim is to provide a secure base layer with functionalities that can be reused

Bitcoin -> protocol (blockchain) in service of a currency
Ethereum -> currency in the service of a protocol
